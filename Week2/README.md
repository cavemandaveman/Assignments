PrintNumberInWord (nested-if, switch-case): Write a program called PrintNumberInWord which prints 
"ONE", "TWO",... , "NINE", "OTHER" if the int variable number is 1, 2,... , 9, or other, respectively.

Challenge

-       Use an interface which has 2 methods. One to convert the number and another method to just print it.

-       Need 2 classes one achieving the result using an if statement, one using a switch ststement.

-       Use an ENUM

-       Use a stand alone appliaction class that can run the above scenarios. This class should not have any implementations.




 

Basic

SumAndAverage: Write a program called SumAndAverage to produce the sum of 1, 2, 3, ..., 
to an upperbound (e.g., 100). Also compute and display the average. The output shall look like:The sum is 5050The average is 50.5


Challenge

-       Use interface with 3 methods one for sum and one for average, one for printing.

-       Define max upper bound and min lower bounds as constants

-       Add method to do the sum and average of only odd numbers between the range

-       Add method to do the sum and average of only even numbers between the range

-       Use a stand alone appliaction class that can run the above scenarios. This class should not have any implementations.

-       DO NOT use a for loop

SquareBoard  Write a program called SquareBoard that displays the following n×n (n=7) pattern.

# # # # # # #

# # # # # # #

# # # # # # #

# # # # # # #

# # # # # # #

# # # # # # #

# # # # # # #


Challenge

-       Use interface and should have only one method to compute the pattern and print.

-       Separation of responsibilities/loosely coupled

-       Should print square pattern or checkered pattern based on the calling class type.

TimeTable : Write a program called TimeTable to produce the multiplication table of 1 to 9 as shown below:

 * |  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

-------------------------------

 1 |  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

 2 |  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18

 3 |  3  6  9 12 15 18 21 24 27

 4 |  4  8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36

 5 |  5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45

 6 |  6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54

 7 |  7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63

 8 |  8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72

 9 |  9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81


Challenge

-       Use interface with one method called “compute()” that takes 1 argument

-       Argument tells the computation type (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

-       Program should output the appropriate result based on the computation type

-       DO NOT USE IF…ELSE for checking the computation type in the implementation classes

-       Use separation of responsibilities and different classes including for the main application.
